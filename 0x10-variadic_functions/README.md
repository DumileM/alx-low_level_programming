0x10. C - Variadic functions

For this project, I learned:
1. What are variadic functions.
2. How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
3. Why and how to use the const type qualifier

The tasks in this project are:
Task 0: Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
Task 1: Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
Task 2: Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
Task 3: Write a function that prints anything.
