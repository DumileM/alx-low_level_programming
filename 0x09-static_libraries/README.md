0x09. C - Static libraries

Static library is a set of variable and external functions which are resolved in a caller at compile-time and copied into a target application by a compiler, linker, or binder, producing an object file and a stand-alone executable. For this project, we explore the use of static libraries and create them. We also use ar, ranlib and nm.
