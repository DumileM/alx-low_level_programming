0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

For this project, I explored structures and understood when, why and how to use them. Lastly, I learned how to use typedef. This project has the following tasks:

Task 0: Define a new type struct dog.
Task 1: Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog.
Task 2: Write a function that prints a struct dog.
Task 3: Define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.
Task 4: Write a function that creates a new dog.
